The group is led by [Dr. Ian Simpson](mailto:ian.simpson@ed.ac.uk) who has a joint position as Principal Investigator in the School of Informatics at Edinburgh University and as Principal Researcher in Statistical Genomics and Bioinformatics at [Biomathematics and Statistics Scotland](http://www.bioss.ac.uk).
